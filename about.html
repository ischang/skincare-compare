                    This <a href="https://xkcd.com/148/">wobsite</a> was written in: vanilla Javascript,
                    some Ajax/JQuery, HTML/CSS and Twitter Bootstrap magic. It's hosted on Github pages
                    and all the business logic is done completely client side.
                    <br><br>
                    Basically, that means nothing you input will get stored (except by your own local
                    machine/browser) -- there's no server on my end or anything that's going to see what
                    you typed or uploaded.

                <h3 class="subHeader">Why I wrote this</h3>
                    This website began as a simple Python script to make my life easier. I have extremely sensitive skin
                    that breaks out in severe eczema patches when triggered by allergens or heat, so finding products
                    that worked for my skin has always been extremely difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    For years, I avoided skincare products and never put on sunscreen or moistuirizer because it was
                    always a gamble of whether my face would blow up and turn scaly. But one day, I thought enough was enough.
                    Through trial and error, loads of research, I started a spreadsheet and started comparing what
                    products worked, and what triggered my eczema.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted a tool that could let me compare the laundry list of ingredients that each product seemed
                    to have, but besides this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3g34we/cosdna_comparison_tool/">
                    Cosdna tool I found on Reddit</a>, which didn't work for me, there wasn't anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    So I wrote this. The logic behind the scripts I wrote are relatively simple, but it hopefully works
                    in a way to make comparing ingredients simpler. :)
