# skincare-compare
You can find the gh-pages project site here: [Skincare Compare](https://stephanieischang.me/skincare-compare)

## todo (maybe never):

- revamp this a little to have better ux/ui and do some page gen 
- make ingredients case insensitive (v silly that it's not)
- ummmm idk maybe check if the scraper still works

## why i wrote this

This website began as a simple script to make my life easier. I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out in extremely itchy, eczema patches when triggered by allergens or heat, so finding products that worked for my skin has always been extremely difficult. 

Testing out products was always a mess of trial and error, loads of research, dozens of decant bottles, and ritual patch testing. I started a spreadsheet in late 2018/early 2019 and started comparing what products worked and what triggered my contact/atopic dermatitis and eczema. But as my list grew, comparing ingredients became a tedious chore. 

I wanted a tool that could let me compare the laundry list of ingredients that each product seemed to have, but besides [this Cosdna tool I found on r/AsianBeauty](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3g34we/cosdna_comparison_tool/), which didn't work for me, there wasn't anything else. 

So I wrote this. I was inspired by the tool above to add Cosdna scraping, but beyond that, the code is my own. It's not the prettiest and the logic and design is rather simple, but it made my life easier comparing ingredients. And, hopefully, it'll make your life easier as well. Happy holy grail and skincare hunting!

## how to run this code locally

Since these are all static pages with only vanilla Javascript, it should be super easy to run this locally. Once you clone the repository, you can simply just run a simple Python server and hit localhost at whatever port you choose.
