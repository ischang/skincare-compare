# skincare-compare
You can find the gh-pages project site here: [Skincare Compare](https://stephanieischang.me/skincare-compare)

## todo (maybe never):

- revamp this a little to have better ux/ui and do some page gen 
- make ingredients case insensitive (v silly that it's not)
- ummmm fix the scraper since cosdna changed their code again heh

## v simple how to 

1. provide a Ã§sv w/3 columns: name, ingredient list (delimited by space or commas), and reaction (safe/allergic)
2. upload & lists will self-populate

OR

quick compare two sets of ingredients with quick compare

note: cosdna compare doesn't work anymore \o/ i have to fix the scraping or just nix it completely 

## how to run this code locally

Since these are all static pages with only vanilla Javascript, it should be super easy to run this locally. Once you clone the repository, you can simply just run a simple Python server and hit localhost at whatever port you choose.
